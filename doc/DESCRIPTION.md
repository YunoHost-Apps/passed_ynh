Share a password with someone securely by generating single-use URLs so that it doesn't get logged in a mailbox, shown in a messenger app's notification, etc. 

The password is contained in the URL itself as an encrypted string whereas the decryption key stored on the server is deleted after first use or selected timeframe.
